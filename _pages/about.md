I am a research scientist and Assistant Teaching Professor of [Engineering Design](https://www.sedi.psu.edu) at [Pennsylvania State University](https://www.psu.edu/), holding a Ph.D. in [Computer Science and Engineering](https://www.eecs.psu.edu) from the same institution. My research specializes in artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML), with a focus on brain-inspired and neuromorphic computing systems. I develop and optimize spatio-temporal neural networks for computer vision and robotics applications, particularly for low-power edge computing platforms.

I also hold an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a specialization in Control Systems Theory and Algorithms from the [University of Calgary](https://schulich.ucalgary.ca/electrical-software), and a B.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from [Tabriz University](https://ece.tabrizu.ac.ir/en).

With extensive expertise in AI/ML, neuromorphic computing, computer vision, robotics, and control systems, I have contributed to interdisciplinary projects in both academia and industry, focusing on AI/ML training frameworks and advanced control algorithms.
